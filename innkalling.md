Software Patents: Who's Behind the Curtain? 
=====================================================================
by Deb Nicholson

How do the court cases and legislative votes from the past year or so 
impact the stream of seemingly endless software patent suits? Where are 
all these patents coming from? Deb Nicholson will give a top-level view 
of recent and relevant scholarly papers in the field, discuss evolving 
strategies and global efforts to staunch the flow of settlement money. 
She'll discuss the recent trends and financial models that are impacting 
our ability to just get back to making awesome software already.

This talk is for developers, contributors and other non-lawyers who are 
concerned about the global epidemic of software patent suits and how it 
impacts Linux, GNU, Android and other FOSS projects. The audience will 
walk away with a better sense of who is getting sued and why, what 
solutions are gaining traction and what community members can do to help.
